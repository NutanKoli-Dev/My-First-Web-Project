# Secure & Private Messaging Vision for India 🇮🇳

## The Goal
To build or enhance an Indian messaging ecosystem (like Arattai or Sandes) that can act as a robust backup to WhatsApp, focusing on extreme privacy and user trust.

## Key Suggestions for Indian Apps:
* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Implementing Signal Protocol to ensure zero third-party access.
* **Data Sovereignty:** All user data must stay strictly on Indian servers.
* **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** The service provider should not be able to read or monetize user metadata.
* **Seamless Migration:** Tools to import WhatsApp chat history to encourage switching.

## Why this matters?
As a budding developer, I believe India needs "Digital Azadi". Our dependency on foreign apps for private communication is a risk. We need an app that isn't just a "copy" but a global leader in privacy.
